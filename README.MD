## WooCommerce Shipping Estimates

This plugin displays shipping time estimates for WooCommerce shipping methods on the cart and checkout pages. You can show estimates as a day or day range, such as "up to 7 days", or "3-5 days".

You can also display date ranges instead (which are calculated from the days you set), such as "by January 1", or "January 1 - January 3".
