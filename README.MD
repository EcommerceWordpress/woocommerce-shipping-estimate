## WooCommerce Shipping Estimates

This plugin displays shipping time estimates for WooCommerce shipping methods on the cart and checkout pages. You can show estimates as a day or day range, such as "up to 7 days", or "Delivery estimate: 3-5 days".

You can also display date ranges instead (which are calculated from the days you set), such as "Estimated delivery by January 1", or "Estimated delivery: January 1 - January 3".

### Notes

This plugin supports any individual WooCommerce shipping method and can let the user set the estimated delivery time or range in days for each. It **does not** support combined methods like Table Rate Shipping.

You can set a minimum delivery estimate, maximum estimate, or both for any / all shipping methods. The delivery label will adjust accordingly.
